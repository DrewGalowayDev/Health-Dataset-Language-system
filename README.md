# 🩺 Health Data Collection and Language AI System for Low-Resource Kenyan Languages

## 🌍 Overview

This project is building an inclusive, decentralized AI-powered system to support **health data collection**, **early diagnosis**, and **language-based health communication** in **Kenya's low-resource local languages**, including Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, Kalenjin, and Kamba.  

By leveraging the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, modern **NLP models**, and **field data collection tools**, this system bridges the language gap in digital health services, particularly in underrepresented rural communities.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- ✅ **Multilingual Health Dataset** in Kenyan languages (voice and text)
- ✅ **AI-powered NLP** for health translation and diagnosis support
- ✅ **Mobile App for Data Collection** (audio + text)
- ✅ **Decentralized Backend** hosted on ICP canisters
- ✅ **Web Dashboards** for providers, contributors, and admins
- ✅ **Token-Based Contributor Incentives** using NFTs or crypto rewards

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

- Most digital health tools ignore Kenya’s local languages.
- Patients face medical risks due to poor translation and communication.
- There is no publicly available dataset or AI system for health in local Kenyan dialects.
- Early diagnosis tools are limited in low-resource, non-English contexts.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Build an open-access health dataset in Kenyan local languages.
2. Train/fine-tune AI models for multilingual health NLP.
3. Deploy decentralized systems on ICP for secure, scalable access.
4. Empower healthcare workers and patients with voice/text-based health tools.

## 📦 Dataset Contribution Workflow

1. Field workers collect voice/text interviews using the mobile app.
2. Data is uploaded to the system and labeled with **Label Studio**.
3. Transcribed data is anonymized and validated.
4. Data is used to fine-tune domain-specific LLMs (like BioMistral).
5. Contributors receive digital NFT badges and token incentives.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd health_data/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
